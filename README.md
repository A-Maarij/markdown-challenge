## A funny story
In 2018, I was standing infront of a house on a street and talking on phone with a friend. A man came to me and said " If you won't leave, I will kill you'. To be honest, he had a very bad English accent and I did not understant what he was saying. I made him to repeat that he will kill me if I won't leave that location for 4-5 times.

## TL;DR
The funny thing here is: If a person would kill someone he would not repeatly shouting it for 4-5 time. He would just do it.
